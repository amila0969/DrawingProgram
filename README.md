The solution implemented by C#.Net console application

Following commands implemented this solution
- Create a new canvas of width w and height h.
- Create a new line from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2). Currently only horizontal or vertical lines are supported. Horizontal and vertical lines will be drawn using the 'x' character.
- Create a new rectangle, whose upper left corner is (x1,y1) and the lower right corner is (x2,y2). Horizontal and vertical lines will be drawn using the 'x' character.
- Fill the entire area connected to (x,y) with "color" c. The behavior of this is the same as that of the "bucket fill" tool in paint programs.
- Quit the program.
